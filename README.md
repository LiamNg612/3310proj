For student 1-5 ,I created this java file to make TCP and UCP connection to robot.java file.

In student 7 and robot 7, I need to create this two java file to get the default received buffer size and caculate the throughtput.

In Client and Server file, I need to modifidy the received buffer size in the runtime to see what is the impact of it to the socket throughtput.
